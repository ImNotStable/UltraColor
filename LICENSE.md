This Product uses the Foundation library software developed by MineAcademy.org. This license enforces the terms listed under **TERMS AND CONDITIONS** and below this line.

If you decide to use the Foundation library mentioned above in your privately modified versions, which is highly recommended to save time on coding, you are also bound to its terms. These terms can be found at https://github.com/kangarko/Foundation#important-licencing-information.

The Licensor doesn't claim any parts of the Foundation library as their own in the Product. All credit goes to MineAcademy.org.

You are not allowed to redistribute or republish full, partial, or modified versions of UltraColor pubically elsewhere (eg. placing the code into a premium plugin). You can however modify the plugin's source code and use a modified version of UltraColor on your own server or network.

The Licensor also reserves all rights to modify this license and the terms of the license with or without notifications. While you may be notified of any changes, it is your responsibility to check back with this license at any point in time.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS
1. You may do whatever you like with the original work, as long as you:
   * Do not distribute the code pubically elsewhere.
   * Do not sell the code or claim it as your own.
   * You follow the terms of this license.
   * You follow the terms of the Foundation library mentioned above if applicable.
2. Code is provided AS-IS with no warranties or conditions of ANY KIND. The same applies to plugin support.
3. You may purpose changes and improvements to the original work as long as you don't use it in a way that avoids or breaks the terms of this license or break any legal laws that apply to you.

But purposing changes to the Product that infects servers with computer viruses is prohibited.
4. If you purpose a modification, you agree to give all rights to your code to the Licensor IF APPROVED. Therefore, for modifications you purpose, you must own the modifications or have the permission to give the owner's rights to the Licensor. However, in good faith, the Licensor may still credit you or the owner for providing the purposed modifications.
5. In addition to the above term, the Licensor also reserves the right to inspect, ask questions about, and make requests about the code provided to them before approving and pushing it to the public version of UltraColor.
