To report a bug or problem with the plugin, follow the steps below:

1.) Make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.

2.) Please put your Minecraft Version and your issue in the title.
Example: 1.16.3 | Getting “Initializing Legacy Material Support."

3.) Explain clearly and specifically what the problem is.
Example: When a player uses /color, the console displays “Initializing Legacy Material Support," and the player waits about five seconds before the menu finally opens. I've already checked to make sure I'm using material names for the version my server is on. Am I doing something wrong?

4.) If needed, use the /ucolor debug command and upload the created zip file to this issue and any errors in a site like pastebin.com.
How to upload your zip file?
a) Simply drag and drop the ZIP file into the issue field.
